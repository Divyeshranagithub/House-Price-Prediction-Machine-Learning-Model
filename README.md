# House Prediction Machine Learning Model

This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting house prices based on various features. The model is trained on a dataset of historical house sales data and uses regression techniques to make predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model is included in the repository (`data.csv`). It contains various features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and location, along with the corresponding sale prices.

## Installation
To run the machine learning model, you will need Python 3.x along with the following libraries:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
  
You can install these dependencies using pip:
- `pip install pandas scikit-learn`

## Model Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics such as, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared value. These metrics are displayed after running the `House_Price_Prediction.py` script.

## Future Improvements
- Feature Engineering: Explore additional features or transformations to improve model performance.
- Model Tuning: Experiment with different algorithms and hyperparameters to optimize the model.
- Deployment: Deploy the model as a web service or integrate it into a mobile application for real-time predictions.
